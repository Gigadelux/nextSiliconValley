# Next Silicon Valley

Welcome to the "Next Silicon Valley" project! This data science initiative aims to analyze and predict the future hotspots for tech jobs and market growth in the United States. By leveraging data analysis and machine learning, we strive to identify which city will emerge as the next Silicon Valley.

## Project Overview

### Current State

- **Notebooks**:
  - **plotting_tech_jobs**: Analyzes tech job distributions across US cities.
  - **plotting_next_silicon_valley**: Visualizes tech market predictions for US cities in 2035.
  - **models/market_prediction**: Work in progress for predicting tech market trends.

### Future Plans

- **Interactive Website**: A Flutter-based website to interactively explore the data and predictions.
- **AI Model**: Implementing a linear regression or SVM model to predict the next Silicon Valley city based on tech market trends.

## Getting Started
